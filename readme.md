Tampere, 14/8 - 2019

Here you will find 3 notebooks with the tutorials for today. They are probably more detailed than what we can cover in one day. The Notebooks run using Google Colab, which is an online version of a Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.


## Notebooks

- Part1 – Exploratory Data Analysis and brush-up: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RJuro/GA2019/blob/master/GA2019_EDA.ipynb#&offline=true&sandboxMode=true)

- Part2 – Introduction to Machine Learning: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RJuro/GA2019/blob/master/GA2019_Intro_to_ML.ipynb#&offline=true&sandboxMode=true)

- Part3 – Statistical Natural Language Processing 101: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RJuro/GA2019/blob/master/GA2019_Intro_to_NLP.ipynb#&offline=true&sandboxMode=true)

# Useful resources

## Bibliometrics

Freshp aplication paper by Daniel, mapping the "Innovation Systems" research field. Gives a good intro in methodology, also maps the whole IS field (might be handy for you):
